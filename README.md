  - It enables people to book holidays safe in the knowledge that they are visiting a LGBTQIA+ friendly country.

  - The site features consistent navigation and design (such as colour scheme) across all pages.

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project is presented to the judges in a professional manner

  - The project will be presented to the judges by members of the team.

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project demonstrates innovation and creativity

  - The main feature of the site is an interactive map that users can click to discover countries that are safe to visit, and those to avoid.

## Goal

The goal section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project or software described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

- Problem Statement

  - It is illegal in over 70 countries around the world to identify as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and there is therefore a need for a travel site(s) to serve the LGBTQIA+ community with tailored suggestions on where to visit and where to avoid.

- Objective(s)

  - Create a site that allows users to find safe destinations, book holidays to those destinations, and share their experiences afterwards.

- Target Audience

  - LGBTQIA community and their allies.
  - Anyone who is concerned about visiting non-inclusive countries that do not support diversity.

- Benefits

  - Allow users to feel assured that they can travel in safety.

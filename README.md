## Intro

The purpose of this website is to provide an interactive way for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to discover holiday destinations that are safe and supportive of their lifestyle, in countries that celebrate diversity.

## Deployment


The project is deployed on Heroku - visit [Pride & Seek](https://pride-and-seek-8a9b75dfd520.herokuapp.com/).

While clicking on a selection of friendly countries will result in a modal pop-up that allows you to search for interesting excursions at that destination, we were unable to apply this to all friendly countries due to restrictions of the available API. This is also why the search results do not currently feature the ability to book accommodation. 

## User Stories

## Criteria

In this section, we will briefly discuss how our team addressed the applicable criteria:

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project demonstrates an impact on the LGBTQIA+ community

  - The site is specifically designed to enable members of the LGBTQIA+ community to find destinations that are safe and inclusive, enable them to book holidays, and post blogs about there trips (upon signing up for a user account).

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project is realistic and has real world value

  - It enables people to book holidays safe in the knowledge that they are visiting a LGBTQIA+ friendly country.

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project has excellent design and layout

  - The site features consistent navigation and design (such as colour scheme) across all pages. The colours of LGBTQIA+ friendly countries on the interactive map are randomly assigned upon page load, to represent the diversity of the community (unfriendly countries remain grey at all times).

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project is presented to the judges in a professional manner

  - The project will be presented to the judges by members of the team.

- 🏳️‍🌈 The project demonstrates innovation and creativity

  - The main feature of the site is an interactive map that users can click to discover countries that are safe to visit, and those to avoid.

## Goal

The goal section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project or software described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

- Problem Statement

  - It is illegal in over 70 countries around the world to identify as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and there is therefore a need for a travel site(s) to serve the LGBTQIA+ community with tailored suggestions on where to visit and where to avoid.

- Objective(s)

  - Create a site that allows users to find safe destinations, book holidays to those destinations, and share their experiences afterwards.

- Target Audience

  - LGBTQIA community and their allies.
  - Anyone who is concerned about visiting non-inclusive countries that do not support diversity.

- Benefits

  - Allow users to feel assured that they can travel in safety.
